I finally take my time to write my first R-package. I always wanted to do that because it is easier to maintain functions
that one might use more than once (which of course is the idea of writing a function). If functions are collected and maintained in
a package, the whole process is central and one doesn't have to care about the version (this gets quite messy I guess). **But**: Think
about downward-compatibility to make sure your previous work---maybe a dynamic report you want to update frequently---still runs.

If you want to have a look at the package, find it on [my GitHub-account](https://github.com/tinino/tinotools). I also included
the package in [my thesis-template](https://github.com/tinino/knitr-thesis-template). I will definitely extend the package with my other
functions I find useful, but first I want to comment them properly and also add a helpfile.
