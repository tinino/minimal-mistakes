I recently uploaded a template that will make it easier to write academic papers---especially bachelor's or master's thesis---at the University of St.Gallen (HSG) for all who want to combine the outstanding typesetting tool [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org) with the powerful [R-language](https://www.cran.org). Of course, you can customise the template to write a thesis at any university, but it comes with a
predefined front page and academic honesty, such that it fulfills the requirements of the University of St.Gallen. [Have a look at the template, fork it on GitHub, play, customise and help improving it.](https://github.com/tinino/knitr-thesis-template)

I'll try to write a tutorial on how to use this template soon.
